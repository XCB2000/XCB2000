## About Me  
I am now a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne. Initially, I wanted to be a physicist, however after 2.5 years of study (completing the physics major requirements in this time) I've decided that I want to work in data science instead. I have since enrolled into concurrent diplomas in statistics and computer science since Melbourne doesn't have double majors for science.
